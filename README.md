Spacecraft decision making is a critical aspect of space missions. It involves making decisions based on data collected from various sensors on board the spacecraft. These decisions can range from routine tasks to critical manoeuvres in response to unexpected events.

Historically, spacecraft decision making relied on rule-based systems and predefined algorithms. These systems were designed by experts who encoded domain-specific knowledge into a set of rules. While effective in many cases, they had limitations in handling complex, dynamic, and unforeseen situations.

The goal is to develop a deep learning model that can effectively learn from this data to make decisions that align with the rules, while also having the capability to generalize to new and unforeseen scenarios.

Improving spacecraft decision making is crucial for the success and safety of space missions. As missions become more ambitious and complex, there is a growing need for decision-making systems that can adapt to unforeseen circumstances.

Deep learning offers the potential to enhance decision-making capabilities by allowing the system to learn from data, thereby increasing its flexibility and adaptability. Integrating deep learning with RULE master-generated rules combines the strengths of both approaches. Deep learning models, can be trained on spacecraft sensor data to learn complex patterns and relationships. RULE master-generated rules serve as a guiding framework, providing expert knowledge to the learning process.
